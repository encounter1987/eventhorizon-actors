# eventhorizon-actors
A CQRS/ES framework built on top of proto-actor.

This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. It is intended to be a learning exercise and a proof of concept for using proto-actor with CQRS/ES.

## CQRS/ES
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a pattern that separates the read and write sides of an application. This allows for better scalability and performance, as well as a clearer separation of concerns.
ES (Event Sourcing) is a pattern that stores the state of an application as a series of events. This allows for better auditing, debugging, and replayability of events.
## Proto-Actor
Proto-Actor is a lightweight actor model implementation for Go. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while still being powerful enough to handle complex applications. It is based on the actor model, which is a concurrency model that allows for better scalability and performance.
